## Detail

### #21 — Sources: row-tap opens centered modal, condense wording

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Wrap each source `ListTile` in a `GestureDetector` / `InkWell` (remove the trailing `IconButton`). On tap, show a centered `AlertDialog` (not `showModalBottomSheet`) containing the source name, license status, and a brief one-line description. Keep all text under ~120 chars to avoid scrolling on a 360dp-wide dialog. The dialog's positive action is "Enable" / "Disable" and negative is "Cancel".

**Key file:** `source_management_screen.dart`

---

### #22 — Replace "Future Downloads" with "Community Crosswords" + Crosshare

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Remove the "Future Downloads" placeholder section from the Settings → Sources screen. Replace with a "Community Crosswords" section containing a single pre-registered source:

- **Crosshare** — `https://crosshare.org` — `LicenseStatus.openLicense`
  - API: `https://crosshare.org/api/dailymini` returns a public daily mini puzzle in a documented JSON format
  - Register in `SourceRegistry` as `CrosshareSource` implementing `PuzzleSource`
  - Display name: "Crosshare Daily Mini"
  - Attribution required: true (link to crosshare.org in puzzle detail)
  - GitHub reference: `https://github.com/crosshare-org/crosshare`

Wire the downloader into the existing import pipeline once the source is registered. The actual HTTP fetch lives in a new `CrosshareSource` data class under `features/import/data/sources/`.

**Key files:** `source_registry.dart`, `features/import/data/sources/crosshare_source.dart` (new), `source_management_screen.dart`

---

### #23 — Clue panel: scrollable numbered list, dynamic keyboard, haptic scroll

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Three tightly coupled changes:

1. **Scrollable clue lists in number order** — Both the Across and Down columns scroll independently. Clues are sorted by number ascending (already the case in `Puzzle.clues`). Use a `ListView` with a `ScrollController` per column.

2. **Dynamic keyboard width** — `CrosswordKeyboard` should use `LayoutBuilder` so letter keys fill the full available width with no fixed `maxWidth` cap. Keys grow as wide as the screen allows while maintaining proportional spacing.

3. **Panel extends to keyboard top** — Remove any fixed height on the clue panel. It should be `Expanded` and fill all space between the grid bottom and the keyboard top.

4. **Haptic feedback on scroll** — As the user drags the clue list, fire `HapticFeedback.selectionClick()` each time the highlighted item changes (one tick per clue boundary crossed). Gate on the haptics setting.

5. **Cross-side deferred update** — While the user is actively scrolling the Across list, the Down list does not follow until the user lifts their finger and a clue is committed. Then the Down `ScrollController` animates to the matching cross-clue. This prevents jitter. Implement via the `ScrollController.addListener` + a debounce on `onScrollEnd` (`NotificationListener<ScrollEndNotification>`).

**Key files:** `clue_panel.dart`, `crossword_keyboard.dart`, `solve_screen.dart`

---

### #30 — Today page add button: context-aware routing + blue color

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

The floating action button (or equivalent) on the Today/Home screen should:
- Check `SourceRegistry.enabledSources` — if any source has a downloader (Phase 2), route to the community downloader screen; otherwise route to `Routes.import_` (local file pick)
- Color: `#1565C0` (the same blue used for the selected bottom-nav tab indicator)
- For now (no downloader implemented), always route to `Routes.import_`; the condition is wired but the downloader branch is a no-op stub

**Key file:** `home_screen.dart`, `app_router.dart` (if a new route is needed)

---

### #31 — Cross-direction column highlight too prominent

**Type:** Bug / UX
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

When a cell is focused, `CrosswordGridPainter` paints the perpendicular word's cells in a light-blue wash (`#E3F2FD`). At normal cell sizes this makes the letter glyphs hard to read against the tinted background.

**Fix options (pick one):**
- **Remove the cross highlight entirely** — the active word (blue) and focused cell (gold) give enough orientation
- **Thin border only** — paint a 1dp `#BBDEFB` border on cross-word cells instead of flooding the cell background

Preferred: remove entirely. If user testing shows loss of orientation, fall back to thin border. Update `CrosswordGridPainter._paintCellBackground`.

**Key file:** `crossword_grid_painter.dart`

---

### #32 — "Crosscue" home header: centered overlay banner, cold-start only

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Historical note: this banner was implemented, then superseded by a later UX
decision. The cold-start "Crosscue" overlay has been removed, and the Today page
uses `Today` as the AppBar title like the other top-level tiles.

**Key file:** `home_screen.dart`

---

### #33 — Android lifecycle: audit all app states

**Type:** Enhancement / Audit
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Verify the app responds correctly to every Android lifecycle transition:

| State | Android event | Expected app behaviour |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Foreground → Background** | `AppLifecycleState.paused` | Pause solve timer; autosave progress |
| **Background → Foreground** | `AppLifecycleState.resumed` | Resume timer only if puzzle was running (not paused by user); refresh home puzzle list if stale |
| **Background → System kill** | Process death | Progress already autosaved; no action needed at kill time |
| **Hidden (pip / split)** | `AppLifecycleState.hidden` | Same as paused — already handled; verify |
| **Inactive (phone call overlay)** | `AppLifecycleState.inactive` | Do nothing (brief interruption; timer keeps running) |
| **Detached** | `AppLifecycleState.detached` | Flush any pending DB writes |

Check `SolveScreen.didChangeAppLifecycleState` — currently handles `paused` and `hidden`. Confirm `detached` triggers a final `saveProgress` call. Confirm `resumed` does not restart a user-paused puzzle. Add widget test or manual QA checklist to DEPLOYMENT.md.

**Key files:** `solve_screen.dart`, `solve_notifier.dart`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

### #34 — Today page: pie chart completion indicator next to puzzle size

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

Inline a small circular progress indicator after the size label in the featured puzzle card and list rows on the Today/Home screen:

- Size: `18dp` diameter
- Proportion: checked-correct or revealed clues from the puzzle's latest session (0.0 if not started)
- Colors: filled arc = `#1565C0` navy, track = `#E0E0E0` grey
- Not started: empty circle (track only)
- Complete: solid navy circle
- Use a `CustomPainter` arc or Flutter's `CircularProgressIndicator` with `strokeWidth: 2.5` and `backgroundColor`
- Positioned inline: `"15×15  [pie]"` with `4dp` gap between text and chart

The `ArchiveRepositoryImpl.getArchiveEntries()` loads session progress alongside
metadata and derives the fill fraction from locked clues only: a clue counts when
every cell is correct and every cell is either checked-correct or revealed.

**Key files:** `home_screen.dart`, optionally a new `_PieProgress` widget in `home/presentation/widgets/`

---

### #2 — Long-press grid cell → contextual Check/Reveal menu

**Type:** Enhancement  
**Reported:** 2026-05-04  
**Target:** Sprint 6 (can pull into earlier sprint if time allows)

**Description:**  
Long-pressing any white (non-black) cell in the crossword grid should show a
contextual popup menu anchored near the tapped cell. This gives quick access
to check/reveal actions without reaching up to the `⋮` AppBar menu.

**Menu items:**
- Check letter
- Check word
- ─── (divider)
- Reveal letter
- Reveal word

> Reveal puzzle is intentionally omitted from this menu — it is a
> high-impact action that belongs in the AppBar menu with its confirmation
> dialog (topic-11).

**Implementation notes:**
- Detect long-press in `CrosswordGrid` via `GestureDetector.onLongPressStart`
  (use `onLongPressStart` to get the local position for menu anchoring).
- Convert the long-press position to `(row, col)` using the same hit-test math
  as `onTapDown`.
- Move focus to the long-pressed cell first, then show the menu so the menu
  always acts on the correct cell.
- Use `showMenu<_CheckRevealOption>()` with a `RelativeRect` derived from the
  tap position to anchor the menu near the cell.
- Call the same `SolveNotifier` methods (`checkCell`, `checkWord`, etc.) that
  the AppBar menu already uses.
- Key file: `crossword_grid.dart` — add long-press handler alongside the
  existing `onTapDown` handler.

### #5 — Solve screen: replace ClueBar header with inline word highlight only

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
The current solve layout has a `ClueBar` widget above the grid that shows the active clue number + text ("27A Main components in Velcro"). Remove this bar entirely. The active word highlight in the grid itself (blue row/column) is the primary visual cue. The clue text still appears in the clue panel below the grid.

Repeated taps on the **same already-focused cell** should toggle direction (across ↔ down). This behavior already exists in `SolveNotifier.tapCell()` — verify it is working correctly once the ClueBar is removed.

**Implementation:**
- Remove `ClueBar` widget call from `SolveScreen` layout
- Remove `ClueBar` import
- The freed vertical space goes to the clue panel (Expanded flex) and/or keyboard
- Keep `SolveNotifier.tapCell()` toggle-direction logic as-is — it already toggles on same-cell tap

**Key files:** `solve_screen.dart`, `clue_bar.dart` (can be deleted once removed)

---

### #6 — Keyboard: larger keys for finger-friendly tapping

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
Current spec: `height: 36dp`, `fontSize: 12px`. Keys feel small on a physical device. Increase to `height: 44dp`, `fontSize: 14px` for letter keys; `height: 44dp`, `width: 46dp` for `⌫` and `✓` special keys. For small puzzles (≤ 7×7), use `height: 48dp`, `fontSize: 15px` (already spec'd in §03).

**Key file:** `crossword_keyboard.dart`

---

### #9 — About screen: icon, description, GitHub link

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
The current About section in Settings is a stub row. Replace with a proper screen or expanded tile containing:
- App icon (from assets or `Image.asset`)
- App name "Crosscue" in `20px w600`
- Tagline: "A clean, offline-first crossword app for Android" in `14px #666`
- Version string from `package_info_plus` (add package if not present)
- Tappable GitHub URL: `https://github.com/AtomicTrxn/crossque` using `url_launcher`

**Key file:** `settings_screen.dart` — expand the About list tile or push a new `AboutScreen`

---

### #12 — Crash reporting: save to local file (Phase 1)

**Type:** Bug / Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
`NoOpCrashReporter` in `core/telemetry/crash_reporter.dart` silently discards all errors. For Phase 1, implement a `LocalCrashReporter` that:
- Appends crash details (timestamp, error message, stack trace) to a rolling log file at `<documents>/crash_log.txt`
- Caps the file at 500 KB (trim oldest lines on overflow)
- Exposes a `Future<String?> readLog()` method for future diagnostic export

Wire it up in `core_providers.dart` replacing `NoOpCrashReporter`. No transmission yet — that is Phase 2 (Sentry / Firebase Crashlytics).

**Key files:** `core/telemetry/crash_reporter.dart`, `core/providers/core_providers.dart`

---

### #16 — Revealing entire puzzle does not mark as complete

**Type:** Bug
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
`SolveNotifier.revealGrid()` fills every cell with the solution letter and sets each cell's state to `CellState.revealed`, but does not call `_checkCompletion()` (or equivalent) afterward. The puzzle stays in `inProgress` status indefinitely and the completion sheet never appears.

**Fix:** After filling all cells in `revealGrid()`, explicitly set:
```dart
status = PuzzleStatus.revealed
```
and call `_markComplete(CompletionType.revealed)` so the session is persisted and the completion sheet is triggered.

**Key file:** `solve_notifier.dart` — `revealGrid()` method

---

### #10 — Export / Import session stats

**Type:** Bug / Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06
**Decisions:** 2026-05-06

**Scope:** Completed `solve_sessions` rows only — not puzzle files, not cell progress, not incomplete sessions.

**Format:** JSON array of session objects:
```json
[
  {
    "completionType": "clean",
    "elapsedMs": 312000,
    "solvedDateLocal": "2026-05-06",
    "solvedTimezone": "CST",
    "width": 15,
    "height": 15,
    "puzzleTitle": "Themeless Monday #875"
  }
]
```

**Export:** Query all rows in `solve_sessions` where `status = 'completed'` or `'revealed'`, serialize to JSON, share via Android share sheet (`share_plus`, already in stack).

**Import:** Parse JSON, for each record insert into `solve_sessions` if no existing row matches `(puzzleTitle + solvedDateLocal)` — additive, never replaces. After import, invalidate `statsDataProvider` so the stats screen recomputes. No changes needed to `StatsRepositoryImpl` — it runs over the larger dataset automatically.

**Rationale for detail over summary:** `StatsRepositoryImpl` computes every stat (streak, personal best, completion rate) from raw session rows. Exporting summary numbers would force a second codepath in stats; streak calculation requires per-day `solvedDateLocal` dates that can't be reconstructed from aggregated values.

**Key files:** `settings_screen.dart` (wire up the stubs), new `StatsExportService` in `features/stats/data/`, `stats_dao.dart` (add `getAllCompletedSessions()` query)

---

### #13 — Colorblind mode: Deuteranopia dot indicator

**Type:** Bug / Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06
**Decisions:** 2026-05-06

**Visual:** When colorblind mode is enabled, draw a small filled circle (dot) in the upper-right corner of any cell whose `CellState == checkedCorrect` or whose letter matches the solution. Dot color: `#1565C0` (navy — safely distinguishable for deuteranopes). No palette swaps needed.

**Extensibility:** Define a `ColorblindMode` enum in `enums.dart`:
```dart
enum ColorblindMode { none, deuteranopia }
// Future values: protanopia, tritanopia, highContrast
```
Store the selected value in `AppSettingsRepository` (replace the current `bool` with the enum string). `CrosswordGridPainter` reads the mode and dispatches to a `_paintAccessibilityOverlay(canvas, cell, rect, mode)` method — adding a new type is one new case in that switch.

**Settings screen note** (below the toggle/picker):
> "When enabled, a dot appears in the corner of correct letters."

**Key files:** `crossword_grid_painter.dart` (dot rendering), `enums.dart` (new enum), `app_settings_repository.dart` / `app_settings_repository_impl.dart` (store enum), `settings_screen.dart` (add explanatory subtitle), `settings_providers.dart` (update notifier type)

### #14 — Sounds: programmatic beeps via audioplayers; merge with haptics

**Type:** Bug / Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06
**Decisions:** 2026-05-06

**Package:** `audioplayers` — add to `pubspec.yaml`.

**Sound generation:** Generate soft sine-wave beep at app startup, cache as `Uint8List`, play via `AudioPlayer.play(BytesSource(...))`. Parameters:
- Frequency: 440 Hz (A4) — warm, not sharp
- Duration: 80ms
- Envelope: 5ms attack, 60ms sustain, 15ms release
- Amplitude: 0.4 (gentle, not jarring at max volume)

One sound variant is enough for all events. Volume/pitch variation (e.g. higher note on word complete) is a future enhancement.

**Trigger points** — mirror haptic trigger points exactly:
| Event | Haptic | Sound |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Key tap | `lightImpact` | soft beep |
| Word complete | `mediumImpact` | soft beep |
| Puzzle complete | `vibrate` (pulse) | soft beep |
| Check correct | *(none)* | soft beep |
| Check incorrect | `vibrate` | *(no sound — haptic only)* |

**Settings section rename:** Rename the current "Sounds" / "Haptics" area in `settings_screen.dart` to **"Touch & Sound"**. Group haptics toggle and sounds toggle together under that header. The name avoids confusion with "Send Feedback" type affordances.

**Key files:** `pubspec.yaml` (add `audioplayers`), new `core/audio/sound_player.dart`, `settings_screen.dart` (rename section, group toggles), `solve_screen.dart` / `crossword_keyboard.dart` (wire sound calls alongside haptic calls)

### #17 & #18 — Clue panel: tappable rows, auto-center, larger font, 5-clue limit

**Type:** Enhancement
**Reported:** 2026-05-06

**Description:**
Three related improvements to the clue panel below the grid:

1. **Tappable clue rows** — Tapping any visible clue row in the panel should call `SolveNotifier.tapCell(clue.startRow, clue.startCol)` (or the first empty cell in that word) and set direction to match the clue. This lets users navigate by clue rather than by cell.

2. **Auto-center active clue** — When the focused word changes, animate the across and down `ScrollController` so the highlighted clue row is vertically centered in its half of the panel. Use `ScrollController.animateTo` with `150ms easeOut` (already spec'd in design/README.md §02).

3. **Font size and row limit** — Increase clue text from current size to `14px`. Show at most 5 visible rows per column (across / down) so the panel has a fixed height. Combined with removing the `ClueBar` (#5) and larger keyboard keys (#6), this keeps the full layout within the screen without scrolling.

**Key file:** `clue_panel.dart`

---

### #3 — In-app puzzle downloader for free/licensed sources

**Type:** Enhancement  
**Reported:** 2026-05-04  
**Target:** Sprint 8+ (depends on `SourceRegistry` from Sprint 8; legal review required per source)

**Description:**  
Add an in-app downloader so users can fetch today's puzzle directly without
manually finding and importing a file. Only sources with `LicenseStatus` of
`openLicense` or `explicitPermission` may be enabled (topic-07 hard rule).

**Prep shipped 2026-05-06:**  
`PuzzleSource` now carries license URL, permission contact, cache policy,
raw-payload retention, commercial-use, last-review, and review-note metadata.
Settings → Puzzle sources exposes those fields and includes a source review
checklist. A reusable review template lives at
`docs/source-legal-review-template.md`. This issue remains open because no
online source has been rights-cleared for downloader implementation.

**Update 2026-05-06:**  
Crosshare is visible as a Community Crosswords candidate, but downloader
implementation is still blocked here. Crosshare's app code is AGPL-3.0; hosted
puzzle-content rights, API terms, attribution, and cache policy still need
human review before Crosscue may fetch or cache puzzle bodies.

> ⚠️ **Legal guardrail:** Read [topic-07](research/topic-07-legal-tos-puzzle-sources.md)
> in full before writing any downloader code. Universal, LA Times, and The Guardian
> are currently classified `needsReview` — they **must not** be enabled until
> written permission or an official API agreement is in place.

**Candidate sources and API status:**

| Source | API / Feed | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Universal Crossword** | Public JSON endpoint (no auth, static token in URL) | `needsReview` | Best candidate — clean REST API, no scraping. See topic-01 for URL pattern. Contact Andrews McMeel for permission. |
| **LA Times** | AmuseLabs platform — has an official paid API (`client_id`/`client_secret` via `support@amuselabs.com`) | `needsReview` | Unofficial token extraction is fragile (breaks on AmuseLabs changes). Use official API path if licensed. |
| **The Guardian** | No public API for crosswords. Data embedded in HTML (`<gu-island>` element). Guardian Open Platform API exists but crossword coverage needs direct verification. | `needsReview` | Requires HTML parsing (`html` package). Guardian Open Platform API key needed for any official path. |
| **NYT** | No public API; subscription required | `prohibited` | Do not implement. |
| **Indie / constructor feeds** | `.puz` / `.ipuz` direct download URLs published by constructors | `openLicense` (per feed) | Safest path for Phase 1 — many constructors publish free daily feeds. Needs a feed registry. |

**Recommended implementation order:**
1. Finish Sprint 8 `SourceRegistry` + `LicenseStatus` enforcement first — this is the gate.
2. Research indie constructor feeds (e.g. Matt Gaffney's daily mini, Brendan Emmett Quigley) that publish permissive-licensed `.puz` files — these may become `openLicense` only after source-specific review confirms the license, attribution, and cache policy.
3. Contact Andrews McMeel about Universal Crossword API/syndication agreement.
4. Contact Guardian Open Platform (`open.platform@guardian.co.uk`) to confirm crossword availability and terms.
5. Approach LA Times / Tribune via official AmuseLabs API channel.

**Architecture notes:**
- Implement each source as a `PuzzleSource` subclass (Sprint 8 abstraction).
- Add source/downloader management under Settings. Do not make downloader
  discovery a primary Home affordance while the app remains local/offline-first.
- Fetched puzzles flow through the existing `ImportRepositoryImpl` pipeline (parse → duplicate check → persist) so the solve experience is identical to local imports.
- Add a `fetchedAt` / `expiresAt` cache policy respected per source row.
- Network calls: `dio` is already in the stack (see `pubspec-starter.yaml`).
- HTML parsing (Guardian): `html` package (pub.dev).
- Reference implementation: [xword-dl](https://github.com/thisisparker/xword-dl) — actively maintained Python downloader for all three sources. Use as technical reference only, not as a dependency.

**Key files to create (post Sprint 8):**
- `features/import/data/sources/universal_source.dart`
- `features/import/data/sources/guardian_source.dart`
- `features/import/data/sources/amuselabs_source.dart`
- `features/import/data/sources/indie_feed_source.dart`
- `features/settings/presentation/screens/source_management_screen.dart`

### #4 — Keyboard appearance causes grid/layout to shift

**Type:** Bug / UX  
**Reported:** 2026-05-04  
**Shipped:** Sprint 6 hotfix

**Description:**  
When the user taps a cell, the soft keyboard slides up and the entire solve
layout (grid + clue panel) is pushed upward to avoid being occluded. The
result is a jarring jump: the grid shrinks, shifts position, and then snaps
back when the keyboard is dismissed. On a puzzle that's already filling most
of the screen this is particularly disorienting.

**Root cause:**  
`Scaffold` defaults to `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: true`, which causes the
body to shrink by the keyboard height on every appearance/disappearance.
The grid is inside an `Expanded` widget, so it reflows each time.

**Preferred fix — keep keyboard behind the layout (overlay model):**  
Set `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false` on the `SolveScreen` `Scaffold`.
The hidden `TextField` that drives the soft keyboard lives at `(-200, -200)`
off-screen, so the keyboard can appear without affecting layout at all.
The user sees the grid stay perfectly still; only the system keyboard
overlaps the bottom of the screen (which is acceptable — the clue panel
sits above the keyboard safe area anyway).

**Implementation notes:**
- In `SolveScreen.build()`, add `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false` to the
  `Scaffold`.
- Verify the clue panel remains visible above the keyboard. If it gets
  clipped, wrap the `CluePanel` row in a `Padding` that adds
  `MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom` when non-zero.
- The hidden `TextField` is positioned absolutely at `(-200, -200)` so it
  is unaffected by inset changes.
- Test by tapping a cell, typing several letters, then dismissing — the
  grid must not move at all during the keyboard animation.

**Alternative considered:**  
`KeyboardDismissBehavior.onDrag` on a wrapping `ScrollView` — rejected
because the grid is not scrollable and we do not want drag-to-dismiss
interfering with grid swipe gestures.
