# Crosscue

Crosscue is a clean, offline-first crossword app for solving your own puzzle files on Android.

Import `.puz` or `.ipuz` crossword files, solve them with a touch-friendly interactive grid, and keep your progress, history, and stats on your device.

## Features

- Import `.puz` and `.ipuz` puzzle files from your device
- Solve with a full crossword grid and clue panel
- Check or reveal letters, words, and the full puzzle
- Resume puzzles with progress, timer, and position restored
- Track solve history, streaks, and stats
- Light, dark, and system theme
- Colorblind mode (deuteranopia dot indicator)

## Offline by Design

All puzzles, progress, and stats stay on your device. No account required. The app does not include built-in puzzle downloads — future sources will only be added once legally cleared.

## Status

Core puzzle importing, solving, persistence, archive, stats, settings, and onboarding are complete. Active development continues — see [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AtomicTrxn/crosscue/issues) for planned work.

**Phase 1: Android.** iOS is Phase 2.
