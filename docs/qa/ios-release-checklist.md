# iOS Release QA Checklist

Run this once per public-facing iOS release (TestFlight external, App Store) on
both an iPhone and an iPad. Takes ~15 minutes per device once the build is
installed.

**Prerequisites**
- TestFlight build processed and installable (you'll get an email from Apple
  when processing finishes — usually 5-30 minutes after the workflow's
  TestFlight upload step succeeds)
- TestFlight app installed on the target devices
- A `.puz` or `.ipuz` file available — easiest: AirDrop one from your Mac, or
  open from Files / Mail / Messages

**Known issues to skip** (these are already filed; don't re-report)
- **#105** — Tapping outside the rebus modal (or pressing Enter on iOS) shows
  a red debug-screen. Release builds have assertions stripped, so this only
  shows up on a debug install. If your TestFlight build still surfaces it,
  file a new bug.

## 1. Install & first launch

- [ ] App installs from TestFlight without errors
- [ ] App icon and display name render correctly on the home screen
  (icon should not be the default Flutter "F", name should be "Crosscue")
- [ ] First launch shows onboarding or a non-empty home screen (no crash, no
  blank white screen)
- [ ] Status bar text is visible (light text on dark backgrounds, dark on light)
- [ ] No content is clipped by the Dynamic Island / notch / home indicator

## 2. Import a puzzle

- [ ] Share a `.puz` file from another app (Files, Mail, Messages) → Crosscue
  appears in the share sheet
- [ ] Selecting Crosscue opens the puzzle directly (no intermediate "imported"
  screen issues)
- [ ] Repeat with a `.ipuz` file
- [ ] Imported puzzles appear in the home/library list with correct metadata
  (title, source, date)

## 3. Solving — basic input

- [ ] Tap an empty cell → cell highlights, keyboard appears
- [ ] Type a letter → letter fills the cell, focus advances to the next cell
  in the current direction
- [ ] Tap the same cell again → solve direction flips between Across and Down
- [ ] Swipe left/right or up/down across cells → focus moves accordingly
- [ ] Backspace → removes the current cell's letter, focus moves back one cell
- [ ] Tap a clue in the clue list → grid jumps to that clue's first cell

## 4. Solving — rebus

- [ ] Long-press a cell → rebus dialog opens with current content pre-filled
- [ ] Type a multi-letter entry (e.g., `EST`) and press the **Enter** button →
  cell shows the rebus correctly, focus advances
- [ ] Long-press the same cell again → rebus dialog reopens with the current
  rebus content pre-filled (matches NYT pre-fill behavior)
- [ ] **Skip:** tap-outside-to-save. Known bug #105 — close with the Enter
  or Cancel button instead.

## 5. Persistence

- [ ] Solve about ⅓ of a puzzle, then put the app in the background (swipe
  up to the home screen)
- [ ] Reopen Crosscue → puzzle resumes exactly where you left off, timer
  continues from the right point
- [ ] Force-quit Crosscue (swipe up + away from app switcher) → relaunch →
  same puzzle, same progress, timer correct

## 6. Stats

- [ ] Complete a small puzzle end-to-end → stats screen shows the entry with
  the correct time and date
- [ ] Streak indicator (if shown) reflects the completion

## 7. Settings & privacy

- [ ] Settings → toggle theme (Light / Dark / System) → app theme switches
  correctly without restarting
- [ ] Settings → Privacy & Data → Privacy policy → opens the published policy
  in Safari (`https://atomictrxn.github.io/crosscue/privacy.html`)
- [ ] Any other in-app links resolve to working URLs

## 8. Visual & accessibility

- [ ] Toggle dark mode → all screens still look correct (no white-on-white
  text, no missing icons)
- [ ] Toggle iOS Dynamic Type to "Larger Accessibility Size" (Settings →
  Accessibility → Display & Text Size → Larger Text) → app text scales, no
  overlapping content
- [ ] (Optional) Toggle Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency → app
  remains usable
- [ ] (Optional) VoiceOver smoke test on the home screen → focusable
  controls are reachable and announced

## 9. iPad-specific

Skip if testing on iPhone only.

- [ ] App launches in portrait → grid uses the wider layout, not a centered
  iPhone-sized column
- [ ] Rotate to landscape → grid + clue panel reflow correctly (no clipping,
  no overlapping panels)
- [ ] Split View with another app side-by-side → app reflows at smaller
  widths without crashing or losing state
- [ ] Slide Over (small floating Crosscue window) → app remains usable, no
  rendering glitches
- [ ] iPad keyboard shortcuts (if supported) — Cmd-Z / Cmd-Shift-Z, arrow
  keys, return — behave as expected

## 10. Edge cases

- [ ] Cycle Airplane Mode on/off → no crashes, no offline error banners that
  shouldn't appear (Crosscue is offline-first)
- [ ] Open a puzzle, lock the device, wait 30s, unlock → app resumes at the
  same cell, timer doesn't lose seconds inappropriately
- [ ] Receive a notification or phone call mid-solve → app handles
  interruption gracefully when foregrounded again
- [ ] Low-memory: install on the oldest supported device you own (minimum
  iOS target is `13.0` per `Runner.xcodeproj`) and confirm core flows still
  work

## Reporting bugs found during QA

For each bug:
1. Take a screenshot or screen recording on the device
2. Open a new GitHub issue at https://github.com/AtomicTrxn/crosscue/issues/new
3. Include: device + iOS version, reproduction steps, expected vs. actual,
   the screenshot or recording

Block submitting for review if any item in sections 1-7 fails. Items in 8-10
are nice-to-have for v1.0 — file as enhancement issues rather than blockers.

## After QA passes

1. Mark this release's QA pass complete in the release issue
2. App Store Connect → submit the prepared build for review
3. Monitor App Store Connect for review status; typical turnaround is 1-3 days
